description: 'Rebel Spurs is a novel that begins in the aftermath of the Civil War.
  In 1866, only men uprooted by war had reason to ride into Tubacca, Arizona -- a
  nondescript town as shattered and anonymous as the veterans drifting through it.
  So when Drew Rennie, newly discharged from Forrest''s Confederate scouts, arrives
  leaving everything he owned behind him -- his thoroughbred stud Shiloh, a mare about
  to foal, and a mule -- he knows his business will not be questioned. To anyone in
  Tubacca there could be only one extraordinary thing about Drew, and that he could
  not reveal: his name, Rennie.'
